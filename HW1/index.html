        <p>About Me</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Education and Experience</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>My name is Kaeli Moore and I am a Game Design Major and will be graduating
         this spring with a BFA in Game Design and Interactive Media as well as a certificate 
         in Web Design. I despite entering this major to pursue art have fallen in love 
         with coding (well as much as anyone can). I have had the fortune to work with 
         Muteki and have gained experience playtesting and picking up as much information
         from my coworkers as possible. Ideally I will pursue a career in game development
         post grad but I will have to see what the world has in stor
         for me.</p>

        <h3>Interests</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I love to be outside hiking, snowbaording or swimming whenever I can, but I 
            also love to spend time reading or gaming. Travelling has also become one of
            my favorite activities in the past couple years, I love seeing new places and 
            experiencing different people, culture, perspectives and most importantly food. 
            That all being said I love any puzzle platformer, bonus points if they are pixelated.
            My first introduction to video games was when I was about eight and I got my very 
            own pink Nintendo DS. My favorite game at that point was <i>Cooking Mama</i>
            which also happened to be my little sisters favorite game, which meant a lot of waiting.

        <h3>Q&As</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5>What do you see when you look at the world?</h5>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I see a place that is full of beauty despite all that is wrong with it. People who 
            are all just figuring thing sout as they go. Everyone you see is living life for 
            the first time, each day holding something new for us all. There is so much joy to be
            found as long as you are willing to see it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5>What is the most pressing issue that we face today?</h5>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I think the most pressing issue we face at the moment is that we are taking multiple steps 
            backwards in terms of equality. People no matter their gender, sexuality, ethnicity or
            anything should be treated differently or given a different set or rights for being
            who they want to be. It is absolutely abhorent that we have not all come to this conclusion.
            People shoul dbe able to live their lives as they please as long as they are not harming
            those around them.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5>What do you do to confront it? <h5>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I find confort in the fact that no matter what I can only control my actions and how I carry myself.
            At the end of the day my life is only as good as I make it, and as long as I kind find joy in little 
            things and fulfill my passions I will lead a life I am proud of.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5>Do you think games can help us solve some of our problems?<h5>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I think that games cans solve some problems with their ability to share stories, perspectives and 
            present them in a manner that is low stakes. They allow people to broach topics that are difficult 
            due to people previous experiences. They can also create a common ground for people to bond over
            which is a powerful tool.
